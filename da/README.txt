This is a demo with the following players: 

- DB
-html file


The mail incentive is to create some graphs analysing the data in the DB. The graph shows the % of of samples in teh DB between [0-15] degrees and [0-30] degrees.

Next steps will be: 

-Take out the random values at the beginning
-For the moment, the code is only considering in the histogram values of 3 and 25 degrees. DataAnalytics(data) in script_da.js should consider a range, as depicted in the x coordinates of the graph.
